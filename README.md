# Staistical_Analysis and Hypothesis Testing on Maximizing the Revenue.

This is the project is on Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Cab Drivers through Payment Type Analysis.
The main objective of this project is  to run an A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate more cash. In particular, we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.

Since the data source file is big I am uploading the link here so that you can go and download the file open the Jupyter Notebook and start working.
THe link for csv file and its public data source available for everyone:

The complete explanation about the project is explained along with the code in the Notebook for clear understanding.
The major Learnings from this is project will be on 
>Descriptive Analysis,
>Hypothesis Testing,
>Regression Analysis.
